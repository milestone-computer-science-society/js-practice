**How to use this package**
--
Install and launch it by running `npm i @comsci/js-practice && npm explore @comsci/js-practice -- npm start` in an empty folder (make sure to `npm init -y` first). You can change the server port by changing the `PORT` environment variable. Additionally, appending `-- --nobrowser` will stop the script from opening the interface in your default browser. You can then visit http://localhost:3000.

All scripts are saved in your `files` folder. The file name structure is as follows: `<challenge-id>.<timestamp>.js`.
Your test data is saved in the `progess/progress.json` file. Save this as well if you are backing up your data.

**Have fun solving the challenges!**

Warning: the code is executed with standard node.js privileges. Be careful when running unknown code.
